What's a great resource to understand how quant works for someone who understands engineering and math? Would much appreciate  it!
Does this trade depend on knowing the market close price before trading the market close? Because that's not how real life works.
"No, this is not how quant works."

"This contradicts the first claim you made above, that you'll be ruled out if not Ivy League. Now you're saying ""top picks"". Contradiction.

I have not said anything about preferences, only saying even outside Ivy league you get a chance. And that includes overseas unis. Ask me how I know."
"> Quickly solving problems is pretty common in interviews.

Is it still?

I remember it was in vogue in the early 2000s. Goldman was famous for just ramping up the pressure by asking rapid fire questions until you broke, but i haven't seen it in the past 10 years.

Which makes sense.

Back in 2000 most of the stress was on the trader, now most of the difficult decisions are made by computers with people just coming into clean up the straggling positions left by the computer so the stress on the trader has come way down in the past 25  years.

High stress interviewing had its moment, just like only hiring 6'4"" former athletes was important when everyone had to crowd out others in the pit for trading.  

Both those times have long since passed."
"All the top ones lol 
Of course there are always exceptions, but you can't deny that ivy leagues are always their first pick and they go there first.
When you see all employees are from ivy leagues it's pretty obvious."
